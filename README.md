# Sindhu Kommathoti â€“ Business Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Iâ€™m a **Business Analytics student at St. Lawrence College (graduating Dec 2025)** with 3+ years of professional experience in **data management, HR operations, and client service**.  
I combine technical skills in **Power BI, SQL, R, Python** with strong business acumen to turn data into actionable insights.

---

Through hands-on academic and real-world projects, I have built expertise in:  
- **Designing dashboards and data models** in Power BI and Tableau that transform raw data into actionable insights.  
- **Applying statistical and machine learning techniques** in R and Python for forecasting, clustering, and predictive modeling.  
- **Optimizing business operations** by analyzing KPIs in domains like healthcare, supply chain, finance, and customer experience.  

What sets me apart is my ability to **bridge technical skills with business context** â€” I donâ€™t just build dashboards or models, I tell a clear story about what the data means for decision-making.
